OpenGL project
==============

The mission is to create a simple OpenGL application that will display
one's initials and perform various operations upon them: translation,
rotation and scaling. Also, colors should change on user input ( keyboard
or mouse )

Development environment and tools
=================================
I chose to develop this small project on Windows, using MinGW tools for
compiling/linking, gVim for editing source code files, and MSysGit for
version control. The project is hosted at github (https://github.com/mihai-rotaru/cg_project_1 )
A build system isn't employed yet, but I'm thinking of waf ( http://code.google.com/p/waf/ )
