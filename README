OpenGL project
==============

The mission is to create a simple OpenGL application that will display
one's initials and perform various operations upon them: translation,
rotation and scaling. Also, colors should change on user input ( keyboard
or mouse )

Development environment and tools
=================================
I chose to develop this small project on Windows, using MinGW tools for
compiling/linking, gVim for editing source code files, and MSysGit for
version control. The project is hosted at github (https://github.com/mihai-rotaru/cg_project_1 )
A build system isn't employed yet, but I'm thinking of waf ( http://code.google.com/p/waf/ )

As of commit 13d33adb, I began using MinGW32-make for building, since the
number of files increased and managing them became tedious.

Notes on compiling
==================
To build this project you will need to tell the compiler where to find the
freeglut headers and binaries. You can see from the makefile that I puth the
headers in C:\MinGW\freeglut, and the binary ( freeglut.dll ) is kept in the
working directory ( in the same folder as the resulting executable ). I
obtained these files from this zip:

Notes on the executables
========================
In order to run the executables, you will need to have freeglut.dll in the
same folder as the executable, or in a system folder ( such as Windows\System32 )
